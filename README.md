# MemeMe

MemeMe is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user can share it with friends. MemeMe also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table or a grid.


The app has three pages of content:
- mMeme Editor View: Enables a user to add text to an image and share it. 
- Sent Memes View: Enables a user to browse sent memes in a table or a grid.
- Meme Detail View: Displays an image of a sent meme


##### Meme Editor View

The Meme Editor View consists of an image view overlaid by two text fields, one near the top and one near the bottom of the image. This view has a bottom toolbar with two buttons: one for the camera and one for the photo album. The top navigation bar has a share button on the left and a “Cancel” button on the right.

##### Sent Memes View

This view displays recently sent memes. 
If the user taps the “table” tab on the left of the bottom toolbar, sent memes are displayed in a table. If the user taps on the “collection” tab on the right of the bottom toolbar, sent memes are displayed in a grid. Selecting a meme from the table or collection presents the Meme Detail View. Pressing the “add” button brings up the Meme Editor View.
